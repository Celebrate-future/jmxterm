Jmxterm is an open source command line based interactive JMX client written in Java. It lets user access a Java MBean server in command line console without graphical environment. In another word, it's a command line alternative of [jconsole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JConsole). JMXTerm relies on jconsole library at runtime though.

JMXTerm can also be embedded with non-Java programming language such as Perl, Shell and Python, and allow these languages to access Java MBean server programmatically.
